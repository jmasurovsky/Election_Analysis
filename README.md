## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this project is to assist the Colorado Board of Elections in ensuring that votes were counted accurately by completing an election audit of recent election results of a Unites States congressional precinct. Additional tasks were requested in order to complete the election audit, such as:

- The voter turnout for each county

- The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count

- The county with the highest turnout

The Colorado Board of Elections also requested for the process to be automated, therefore using Python was essential.
