## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this project is to assist the Colorado Board of Elections in ensuring that votes were counted accurately by completing an election audit of recent election results of a local congressional precinct. Additional tasks were requested on top of the previously completed audit results, such as:

*The voter turnout for each county

*The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count

*The county with the highest turnout
